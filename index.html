            <h4>Lara C.</h4>
            <p>When my friends and I got shipwrecked on a cursed island, I was able to use what I had learned from my days at Straight to the Point Archery Academy to fight off the horrors that awaited us. The instructors really know what they're doing! 10/10 would recommend!</p>

            <h4>Legolas</h4>
            <p>I've been dabbling in archery for a VERY long time. Though some would say that I'm a master archer, I truly believe practice makes perfect, and what better place to hone your skills than Straight to the Point Archery Academy! It's such a fun and engaging environment that I've finally convinced my best friend Gimli to join a class!  </p>
